Newfoundland empirical data analysis: Elizabeth Forbes

Collected summers 2022, 2023 and consisting of
2022: soil carbon flux (LiCor 8100A) across triplicate 100m transects transversing moose meadows to mature forest (15 total measurements per site); soil C and N content; soil pH; soil moisture and temp; light level; rough ground vegetation composition; canopy cover
2022: soil carbon flux (EGM5) across 3x locations per site, including mature stands, moose meadows, and exclosures; soil C and N content; soil moisture and temp; detailed vegetation community composition (ground, shrub, tree, canopy); moose abundance and activity

Current plans for analysis: flux
- comparison of covariance across canopy cover levels, moose meadow type (timber vs. insect generated)
- comparison of covariance across mature stands vs. exclosures (e.g. 'recovering' from moose browsing)
